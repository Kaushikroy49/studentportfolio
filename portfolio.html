      <h3>tic tac toe</h3>
      <p>A Tic Tac Toe project is a simple yet classic programming exercise that involves creating a digital version of the popular two-player game. This project typically includes a grid (3x3) where players take turns marking either "X" or "O" in an attempt to place three of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). The goal is to implement the game logic to determine if a player has won, lost, or if there is a draw, as well as to reset the game for a new round.</p>

      <h3>Tribute Page</h3>
      <p>A tribute page project is a simple web development project, often created by beginners, to practice HTML and CSS. It typically honors a notable person, concept, or theme by presenting a single web page filled with information, images, and a unique layout. The page includes a structured biography or timeline about the subject, with sections that highlight important life events, achievements, and contributions.</p>
